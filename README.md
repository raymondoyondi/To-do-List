# 📋 Task Manager 

## 🚀 Overview

The **Task Manager** is a simple, yet effective, single-page web application designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently and with minimal fuss. Built using fundamental web technologies (HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript), this application provides a clean, intuitive interface for adding, tracking, and completing your to-do items. It’s perfect for anyone needing a straightforward tool to keep their day organized without the complexity of larger, feature-heavy applications.

This project focuses on providing a snappy, client-side solution for personal task organization, prioritizing ease of use and a smooth user experience.

## ✨ Features

* **Add New Tasks:** Quickly and easily add new tasks to your list via an input field.
* **Mark as Complete:** Toggle the status of a task from pending to complete with a simple click. Completed tasks are visually distinguished (e.g., with a strike-through).
* **Delete Tasks:** Permanently remove individual completed or unwanted tasks from the list.
* **User-Friendly Design:** A clean, minimal, and intuitive interface built with responsive CSS.
* **Client-Side Persistence:** Tasks are stored locally in the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring your list persists even if you close and reopen the application. *(Adjust this point if you do not use `localStorage`)*

## 💻 Technologies Used

This project leverages the power and simplicity of core web development languages:

* **HTML:** Used for structuring the content and semantics of the task manager.
* **CSS:** Utilized for styling the application, ensuring a modern and responsive user interface.
* **JavaScript:** Provides all the interactive functionality, task management logic (adding, deleting, marking complete), and DOM manipulation.
